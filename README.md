# PolyFish

An interactive underwater ecosystem simulation built with Three.js. Watch fish, dolphins, and manatees hunt, eat, reproduce, and die in a living virtual ocean - complete with procedural kelp forests, physics-driven plankton, and a documentary-style camera system.

Originally built in Unity, ported to run entirely in the browser.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Click anywhere to start the simulation.

## What You're Looking At

PolyFish simulates a self-sustaining underwater food chain:

- **Fish** eat plankton particles spawned by kelp, reproduce when well-fed, and flee from dolphins
- **Dolphins** hunt fish, must surface periodically to breathe, and perform killing sprints
- **Manatees** graze on kelp plants, slowly wandering the ocean floor
- **Kelp** grows from seeds dropped by fish, sways with Verlet-chain physics, and produces food

When the ecosystem collapses (all fish die), the simulation restarts with a new seed.

## Features

- Real-time 3D ecosystem with predator-prey dynamics and metabolism
- GPU-instanced rendering (2,100+ entities at playable framerates)
- Jolt Physics WASM for rigid-body simulation on a Web Worker
- Procedural swim animation via vertex shaders
- Documentary-style auto-camera with depth-of-field
- Underwater caustics and volumetric god rays
- WebXR support with hand tracking (Quest 3)
- Narrated introduction sequence with ambient audio

## Modes

**Narrative Mode** (default) - Full ecosystem simulation with staged creature introductions, narration, and music. Press `S` to toggle the documentary screensaver camera.

**Model Viewer** - Inspect individual creature models and their skeletal animations. Access via the mode switcher (requires dev mode).

**Editor Mode** - Tune creature physics, animation, and behavior parameters in real-time. Export configs as JSON.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| WASD | Move camera |
| Mouse | Look around |
| Click + drag | Throw food |
| S | Toggle screensaver camera |
| Shift | Sprint |
| Backtick | Toggle debug colliders (dev mode) |
| Backspace | Restart simulation |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server with hot reload

```

## Making Of

The project includes an interactive series of articles documenting how PolyFish was built, available at `/making-of/` when running the dev server:

- **Origins** - Project history and the Unity-to-Three.js port
- **Creatures** - AI behavior, state machines, and procedural animation
- **Ecosystem** - Food chain dynamics, metabolism, and population balance
- **Kelp** - Verlet chain physics, ocean currents, and plant lifecycle
- **Rendering** - Shaders, caustics, god rays, and GPU instancing
- **Camera** - Documentary director system and cinematic shot types
- **Audio** - Narration, ambient soundscapes, and Web Audio integration
- **Performance** - Profiling, optimization passes, and frame budget management

## Deployment

The project deploys as a static site. A `vercel.json` is included for Vercel hosting (sets required COOP headers for SharedArrayBuffer support).
